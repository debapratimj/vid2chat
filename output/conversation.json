    "Hi Lucy, nice to meet you.",
    "So I understand that you were referred here by your GP because you've beenFeeling quite down recently.",
    "Okay, soFrom your notes I saw that you saw the GP about three months ago.",
    "So how long have you been feeling down altogether?",
    "Okay, so has it got worse since you saw your GP?",
    "Yeah.Okay, so tell me, Emmett, how are things at the moment?",
    "Okay, so you said that you're feeling reallyDown really sad.",
    "youand you feel like you haven't got any motivationAre you okay? Yeah, I'm fine, sorry.Okay.and you haven't got any motivation, but it sounds like you're putting quite a lot of pressure on yourself to try and feel a bit better.",
    "you",
    "So you say you've been quite isolated, there's not many people around.",
    "Okay, so I'm just going to try and find out a little bit more about you. So I understand that you're an English student at uni.",
    "and you live away from home with some friends, is that right?",
    "I love you, too.Okay, so you don't live far from the uni.andbut you say you feel like you live with your friends but you don't feel like you can talk to them.",
    "Okay, so it sounds, do you try and hide the way you're feeling from them?",
    "Okay, so it sounds like you've been feeling down, you've been feeling unmotivated.Um,you feel like you want to be better, but actually it sounds like you feel like you can't reach out for help, you can't speak to anybody.",
    "I'm just going to go back in time a little bit. I suppose I'm just wondering, when did all of this start? You said it's been going on for quite a few months.",
    "Um,",
    "Okay, so this would be like last March, last April? Yeah, I think so. Around that time, so about six months-ish. And it sounds like a lot was happening. So you had a lot of uni pressure on and you said that your parents were having marital problems?Okay.It sounds like that was a real shock to you.",
    "Okay, so it sounds like you were trying to work hard and be more successful because you thought that that would make them happier and try and fix things.",
    "How did it backfire?",
    "Okay, so after the summer, after the exam period, and how did that exam period go for you in the end?Not very well.Okay, that's an awful lot of pressure to put on yourself that you're supposed to think.",
    "Mm-hmm.So you say, I know, I know I should have done better.",
    "I mean, I suppose hearing it from my perspective, I'm thinking it sounds like you had an awful lot going onat the time it would be understandable absolutely that you wouldn't do as well as normal. I suppose I'm just wondering if you have very high standards for yourself.",
    "So it sounds like you feel you should always do your best. Is that the word you used? Yeah. And that there isn't any kind of exceptions for that,",
    "Okay.So I can see then that that was a really difficult time for you and that was when your mood started to get lower.and things are still quite bad now.What's the situation with your parents at the moment?",
    "Okay.",
    "Were you home over the summer?",
    "And how is that?",
    "Mm-hmm.Bye.Okay, so it sounds like quite a lot has been happening. You've been feeling very low. You've had uni pressure on.You've had problems with your parents' marriage and it sounds like you feel like you can't really reach out to anyone, that you can't understand, that you can't really reach out to your parents right now, you can't really confide in your friends.So I suppose I'm just wondering if you can tell me a bit more about how you've been feeling, I mean, say this past week.",
    "Okay.",
    "too.",
    "Thank you.Right, so I suppose I'm just wondering then, let's see if we can,think about one thing, say a lecture, what kind of thoughts do you have about going to that lecture before it happens?",
    "Okay, so it sounds like the kind of thoughts you've got in your head are, it's pointless,it's not worth it.",
    "Do you have any other thoughts in your head when you're just at that point before you go to the lecture?",
    "So it sounds like you feel like you're not as good as other people here.",
    "Okay, I'm just, sorry, is it okay if I take notes as we go through? It's just, I'm trying to, I guess, understand what you're telling me and it helps me just to write it down and I'll share this with you later.",
    "So it sounds like those are some quite negative thoughts to have. You're kind of saying, you know, it feels like it's pointless, it's more effort than it's worth, and I don't deserve to be here.I mean, when you have those thoughts, how do you feel?",
    "Very.",
    "Okay.Okay, so what you described there then, you said, I'm unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better. Those are kind of what I would call thoughts actually. I suppose I'm trying to understand what it feels like in your gut. What kind of emotions do you feel? Happier, do you feel sad? What kind of emotions are you feeling when you have those thoughts?",
    "Yeah.Bye.I notice when you're kind of telling me this, and I know this is quite a heavy topic, but you're kind of laughing. And I suppose I wonder a little bit, are you a bit, you know, how do you feel about having these emotionstalking about these emotions.",
    "Mm-hmm.",
    "Well, you're doing a great job, because I know that this can be difficult.Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are, it's pointless, it's more than it's worth, I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy. And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind.And then you're kind of describing different emotions that those lead to. You're kind of describing sad, anger, frustration, embarrassed. What about in your body? What happens?How do you feel kind of physically?",
    "So it sounds like this is affecting you, it's draining you of your energy, like your body can't be bothered. I think that's a really good way of describing it. And you're noticing sleep problems as well.What do you do? So this is, so we're back to the point before the lecture.So you start having these thoughts, these emotions, and your body, I guess it sounds like those thoughts are quite draining, so they're draining your energy. What then happens, what do you do next?",
    "So you think even more about those kind of worries that you have. So you do a bit of dwelling and you stay in bed.",
    "And it sounds like you don't.You haven't tried speaking to your friends about it.",
    "or speaking to family.",
    "Okay, and then after you've done that, so after you've not gone to the lecture, you've stayed in bed, you kind of spent time, as you said, focusing on those thoughts, those negative thoughts. How do you feel after that? Do you feel better or do you feel worse?",
    "So it sounds like in some ways it's a bit of a relief to do that.",
    "but in other ways maybe you think it might make things worse.",
    "you"

    "",
    "you",
    "Yeah, I thought I shouldI've been feeling quite bad for quite a while so I thoughtmaybe it's time to see someone about it because I don't want to feel like this anymore.",
    "Yeah.",
    "quite a few months before that as well, actually, but it's gotten pretty bad these past few months. So that's kind of why I came.",
    "Yeah.Thank you.",
    "But it kind of started just feeling a bit lowwound up about things butI don't know, just recently I...I just can't really be bothered to do anything at all. I kind of find it hard to get motivated for things. And I want to be, I really,want to be better butit's just kind of reaching the end now where I justI want to do something about it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah, I just...It's kind of hard as well because there's not really anyone to talk about so I'mI just kind of stay on my own trying toI don't like to think about it,I just... Okay.",
    "you",
    "Yeah, the stairs.No one I can talk to about it.Don't listen or understand anyway.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah, I mean...They're lovely, I get on really well with them butI don't know, recently whenever they want to go out or stuff, I just, I don't want to bring them down. I can't, they don't understand what I'm going through.They don't make fun of how I feel, but they don't really understand what it's likeI don't want to go out with them and bring them down or stuff.",
    "I guess, I mean.It's easier to hide it than to try and explain it all the time when no one really wants to know.",
    "No, I don't really talk to my parents about it either.So that's kind of hard.",
    "Yeah.I guess it kind of started when I was actually, when I was revising for my exams, I guess the stress, I put a lot of stress on myself, I think.",
    "I've always wanted to do well for me and I guess for my parents, so the stress of exams and it was also kind of hard because my parents were going through a bit of a troubled time then.",
    "Yeah, I guess.it was hard as well becauseI wasn't doing well at uni, I think.I guess I just felt a bit guilty. I know it sounds silly, but I felt...Like maybe if I could do better then they would get better but it just wasn't really happening.",
    "Yeah, I wanted to make them feel better, but itShe's kind of backfired a little, I guess.",
    "It just ended up with them getting worse.I've just been feeling worse since then.",
    "It's just annoying because I know I should have done better andI just didn't and I guess I beat myself up a lot about it.",
    "Yeah.",
    "probably maybe more than other people.my parents have always kind oftaught me not in a loving way, I guess, but thatyou should do your best but alsoget the best andI agree with that, I think that's the right thing to think. But when I don't do that, I don't know. It annoys me a lot and I worry that it annoys them.",
    "No.",
    "Um...I think it doesn't sound good, I don't really talk to them a lot butI don't think they're going through very good things. I don't like to talk to them about it because it just makes me feel worse.you",
    "but I don't think it's getting any better.",
    "For a little bit, yeah.",
    "Bye.Not very fun.youyouNo. It was quite tense all the time.stressed me out more than relaxed me over the summer, I guess.",
    "andReally not good to be honest.I actuallyIf I don't have to, then I don't really leave the house or get out of bed. I just, I can't.find the motivation for the things I used to enjoy. I used to love doing sports or going out and now I just prefer to lie and better not really do anything.",
    "I missed a few lectures this week that I should have gone",
    "you",
    "I don't really see the point anymore ifIf I can't doas well as I should be doing, then what's the point in putting myself in those positions?I just...I can't be bothered anymore to try.stresses me out more than it needs to.",
    "Yeah.",
    "So like,I don't know.I don't really even deserve to be here if I can't do well enough. I see all these other students who are doing well and doing better and want to be there.Eh.I don't know why I'm here even at uni, to be honest.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Yeah, no.Yeah.you",
    "you",
    "Bye.unworthy probably would be the best way to put it,I don't know.lower than normal. Because then it makes me think about all the things that I should have been doing better.",
    "Sad, not happiness. No, sad. A bit of anger and frustration as well.",
    "I guess.embarrassedMm-hmm.",
    "But I've never really had to talk about it, so it's quite uncomfortable.to be in this situation.",
    "How do you feel?I used to be...I think from those emotions very wound up, very kind of stressed all the time.But recently it's just been a lot more draining than anything.quite lethargic andI just can't be bothered anymore. My body reflects that. But then when I try and sleep, I just can't.seem to have a satisfied night's sleep. It's really, really frustrating.",
    "Um...I kind of focus on the negative thoughts when I probably should not think about them, but I focus on them and then I don't really wanna do anything, kind of stay in bed or",
    "those kind of worries that you have.",
    "No.",
    "Speaking to family.",
    "I guess I fell a bit.slightly worse but thena bit numb in a way, kind of.once you've felt that,I do feel tired all the time.push it out and then you don't really think about anything and it's almost nicer that way than tokeep focusing on how much you're getting wrong and how much you can't do stuff. Sometimes it's better just tonot think about it at all.",
    "Yeah.",
    "Probably in the long run, yeah.Thanks for watching!",
    "you"
