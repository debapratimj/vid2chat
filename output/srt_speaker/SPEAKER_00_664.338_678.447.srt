Okay, so it sounds like some of the thoughts you're describing are,

0:00:03.660 --> 0:00:06.920
it's pointless, it's more than it's worth,

3
0:00:06.920 --> 0:00:10.340
I don't deserve to be here, I'm unworthy.

4
0:00:10.340 --> 0:00:14.120
And those kind of thoughts, it sounds like they just flip through your mind.
