0:00:00.000 --> 0:00:02.700
Okay, so what you described there then, you said,

2
0:00:02.700 --> 0:00:05.700
I'm unworthy, I should be doing lots of things better.

3
0:00:06.600 --> 0:00:09.300
Those are kind of what I would call thoughts actually.

4
0:00:09.300 --> 0:00:11.100
I suppose I'm trying to understand

5
0:00:11.100 --> 0:00:12.620
what it feels like in your gut.

6
0:00:12.620 --> 0:00:14.660
What kind of emotions do you feel?

7
0:00:14.660 --> 0:00:17.040
Happier, do you feel sad?

8
0:00:17.040 --> 0:00:18.800
What kind of emotions are you feeling

9
0:00:18.800 --> 0:00:19.980
when you have those thoughts?
